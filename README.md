# Project

**PORTFOLIO WEBSITE WITH THREE.JS INTERGRATION**

-   Created an interactive, responsive, and realistic 3D Earth using
    React Three Fiber, and custom WebGL shaders.

-   Created an intuitive, and smooth User Interface with Shadcn/ui,
    React, GSAP, and Tailwind.

-   Maintained a modular design principle with the help of Redux and
    React Components.

**TURN-BASED ROLE-PLAYING GAME COMBAT SYSTEM IN 3D UNITY**

-   Created an extendable, generalized, and modularized turn-based
    combat system for a limitless number of entities.

-   Applied realistic lighting, volumetric fogs, and wind simulation to
    enhance immersion for the playable scene.

## Disease and Control Simulation on a Fixed Population

-   Created a 2D Simulation of a dynamically behaved population
    undergoing a pandemic with a heavy use of inheritance and
    polymorphism with C++.

-   Added real-time visualization with QT Creator graphical libraries.

## Visualization of Dijkstra's Algorithm on Customizable Maps with GUI and Storage ImplementationÂ 

-   Designed and coded a real-time visualization of Dijkstra's
    path-finding algorithm on a user-made nodes map.

-   Created an intuitive and reactive GUI with C++ QT Creator GUI
    libraries.

-   Implemented a save/load system to store user's custom-made map.

## Sudoku Solver with Multithread Integration

-   Sudoku Solver using Depth-First Search method. The project applied
    various complex data structure for fast look up time, and
    performance optimization. Currently integrating multithread for
    faster permutation traversal.

## Reverse Polish Calculator with ANTLR integration

-   Applied ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) as a parser.
    Use context-free grammar to break down infix expression into postfix
    expression. Use Gradle as a Java build tool.

-   Added multi-system capabilities with Gradle as build tool and Java
    as language.
