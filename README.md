# Project

## Portfolio Website With Three.Js Intergration

- Created an interactive, responsive, and realistic 3D Earth using React
  Three Fiber, and custom WebGL shaders.

- Created an intuitive, and smooth User Interface with Shadcn/ui, React,
  GSAP, and Tailwind.

- Maintained a modular design principle with the help of Redux and React
  Components.

## Turn-Based Role-Playing Game Combat System In 3d Unity

- Created an extendable, generalized, and modularized turn-based combat
  system for a limitless number of entities.

- Applied realistic lighting, volumetric fogs, and wind simulation to
  enhance immersion for the playable scene.

## Disease And Control Simulation On A Fixed Population

- Created a 2D Simulation of a dynamically behaved population undergoing
  a pandemic with a heavy use of inheritance and polymorphism with C++.

- Added real-time visualization with QT Creator graphical libraries.

## Visualization Of Dijkstra’s Algorithm On Customizable Maps With Gui And Storage Implementation 

- Designed and coded a real-time visualization of Dijkstra’s
  path-finding algorithm on a user-made nodes map.

- Created an intuitive and reactive GUI with C++ QT Creator GUI
  libraries.

- Implemented a save/load system to store user’s custom-made map.

## Sudoku Solver With Multithread Integration

- Sudoku Solver using Depth-First Search method. The project applied
  various complex data structure for fast look up time, and performance
  optimization. Currently integrating multithread for faster permutation
  traversal.

## Reverse Polish Calculator With Antlr Integration

- Applied ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) as a parser. Use
  context-free grammar to break down infix expression into postfix
  expression. Use Gradle as a Java build tool.

- Added multi-system capabilities with Gradle as build tool and Java as
  language.
